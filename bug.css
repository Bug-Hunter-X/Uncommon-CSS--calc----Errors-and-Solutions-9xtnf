The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using it. One such error is using an invalid operator or expression within the `calc()` function. For instance, using an unsupported unit or mixing units inconsistently can lead to unexpected results or errors.  Another issue is neglecting operator precedence.  The order of operations is crucial; parentheses should be used to enforce the desired calculation sequence.  Finally, forgetting to include units after a value or using units inconsistently (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages) often results in rendering problems.
